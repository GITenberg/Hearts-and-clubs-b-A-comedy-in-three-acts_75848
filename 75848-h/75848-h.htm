</div>

<p class="hanging">SCENE <abbr title="One">I</abbr>—<i>A seaside hotel.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy’s</span> <i>sitting-room,
prettily furnished. Table and chairs</i> <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr> <i>Sofa</i> <abbr title="Left"><span class="allsmcap">L.</span></abbr> <i>Doors</i>
<abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr> <i>and</i> <abbr title="Left"><span class="allsmcap">L.</span></abbr> <i>At rise of curtain</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy</span> <i>is discovered
seated</i> <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr> <i>of table reading a newspaper</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy</span> <i>is
lying upon sofa</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> (<i>sighing</i>) O dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> (<i>looking over top of paper</i>) What is the
matter now, Lolly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> The same old thing, this pain in my side,
and there is a strange feeling in the back of my head. I
wonder what it is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> Oh, you want something to distract you.
Come, jump up, and let us go down-stairs and hear the
music. You might as well be at home as moping up in this
room. Come, it will do you good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> O Joey! I couldn’t possibly dress and
go down to-night. Just suppose I should faint!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> Well, suppose you do; you are not likely
to, you know. You would soon get over it, and you
wouldn’t be a mile from your own room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> You are so heartless. I think it is cruel
of you to talk that way. Even if I didn’t faint, those parlors
are so draughty, and the music always makes my head
ache.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> Very well, we needn’t go. (<i>Silence, excepting
the rustling of the paper.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Joe, can’t you read without making such
a noise with the paper? It does distract me so. My poor
nerves cannot stand much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> I cannot very well spend my evening
spelling out the advertisements on one side of the paper.
(<i>Sarcastically</i>) Perhaps I may be able to find a newspaper
of a single sheet <span class="lock">only—one</span> of those patent-inside <span class="lock">arrangements—if</span>
so, I certainly shall take it. (<i>Getting up</i>) Since I
am so unpleasantly distracting, I had better leave you in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
peace. They don’t mind speaking above a whisper at the
club. (<i>Throws down paper and takes up his hat</i>) Good-night;
don’t sit up for me. (<i>Goes out</i>, <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> (<i>burying her head in the pillow and sobbing</i>)
There he goes again to that hateful old club, leaving poor
forlorn me all alone. Oh, these heartless men! (<i>A knock
at the door</i>, <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr>)</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk</span>.)<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> Why, Lolly, what is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> (<i>sitting up and wiping her eyes</i>) O Anna!
I am so glad you came in! It is the same old story, of
course. Joe has gone over to the club, leaving me alone
with nothing to do; I cannot do fancy work, it makes my
back ache; I cannot read, for it makes my head ache, and
so here I am deprived of everything, even my husband’s
society. I am a perfect martyr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> (<i>laughing</i>) Laura, you do make me laugh,
you are so bent upon being miserable. Now, don’t put on
that injured look. I have something to tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> (<i>brightening up</i>) Have you? What is it?
I am dying to hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> First, look at me. Do you see this new
gown?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Yes. How well you look in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> (<i>triumphantly</i>) That is just it. I am one inch
longer in the waist than I was two months ago, and it is all
due to physical culture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Physical culture?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> Yes. You have no idea what it does for
one, and it would be just the thing for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Oh, no! I never could swing those
dreadful Indian clubs and jump over a rope four or five
feet high or squirm in and out of little square places like a
snake. As for a trapeze, I have a perfect horror of one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> Nonsense! That isn’t what you have to
do. Why, it is as simple as can be, to begin with, and has
cured more headaches and backaches than I could begin to
tell you of. See, I will show you a few of the first exercises.
(<i>Rises, and goes through a few movements rather awkwardly</i>)
There, now, that isn’t so dreadfully hard, is it? Come,
Laura, say you will join our club.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Club! Did you say you had a club?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> Yes; one must do something in Lent, and
it is awfully stupid down here, so we have organized a club,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the X. Y. Z. The culmination of knowledge, you see, as
opposed to A. B. C. The X. Y. Z. Club, composed of about
a dozen ladies who are seeking different ends through the
same means; I, for instance, am bent upon decreasing my
size; even “add a cubit to my stature,” and it would not
come amiss if I were able to stretch up to it and out of my
avoirdupois. Mrs. Bodkin, on the contrary, pines for flesh,
for breadth of chest, and mightiness of muscle. Miss Doting,
the dear soul, thinks the movements “such lines of
beauty,” and her prophetic eye sees herself, though spare
of flesh, an undulating, willowy figure, gliding before some
hero’s vision and into his heart; while dear Mintra, her
niece, who has come down here with her, does it all “just
for the fun of the thing.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Well, I really believe I will join you, since
Mr. Joe is so absorbed in his club, and I will show him that
I can have a club, too. Yes, I really will join you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> (<i>delightedly</i>) That is right. We meet to-morrow
in Mrs. Bodkin’s rooms at three o’clock. Now I
must go. Good-night. Don’t get up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Oh! I feel better already. I will go to the
door with you. (<i>They go toward door</i>, <abbr title="Left"><span class="allsmcap">L.</span></abbr>)</p>

CURTAIN<br>
</p>


<p class="p2 hanging">SCENE <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>—<span class="smcap">Mrs. Bodkin’s</span> <i>drawing-room, handsomely
furnished. Large table with lamp down</i> <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr> <i>Doors</i> <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr> <i>and</i> <abbr title="Left"><span class="allsmcap">L.</span></abbr>
<i>and</i> <abbr title="Center"><span class="allsmcap">C.</span></abbr> <i>in flat. Ladies are all present and are preparing
for a meeting of the Club</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy</span>
<i>down</i> <abbr title="Center"><span class="allsmcap">C.</span></abbr></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> Now, Lolly dear, you see us as we are, absolutely
afraid of our teacher, each other, and our own
selves. Mrs. Bodkin, (<i>addressing</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. <abbr title="Bodkin">B.</abbr></span>, <i>who stands
near</i>) do you know I have lost a whole pound, and I am
at least an inch longer in the waist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bodkin.</span> Really? Well, I have found your pound,
and am triumphantly wearing it; and, as for your inch, I
have added that to my chest measure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> You have? What is that Mrs. Pallide is
saying, “Ma za?” Is she seeking a rhyme?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> (<i>laughing</i>) No, that is for exercising the
muscles of the mouth, and so is the sentence she is practicing
now, “Most men want poise and more royal margin.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Do you suppose we really need to exercise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the muscles of our mouths? I fancy our husbands
will hardly think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> Rank treason, my dear! Do they not
need to exercise their biceps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Do look at Miss Doting. Is she invoking
Juno?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> No, she would never invoke any one but
Venus, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> (<i>who has been going through some of the
arm movements most extravagantly, shakes her finger at the
three ladies as she approaches</i>) Ah, my dears, I see you
laughing at me, but as that dear Emerson says in his ode
to “Beauty,” “Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me.”
And, oh! (<i>clasping her hands in a soulful way</i>) I do so long
for “Beauty;” not the tender tints of spring, not the rose
flush of June, but the beauty of autumn. Oh, surely,
surely I may consider that I am not too late in seeking that
aftermath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Oh, surely, surely not too late, Miss
Doting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> You look so well to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bodkin.</span> That is a most becoming costume.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> Oh! do you think so? Pet laughed at
me, and though she is too dear a child to say so, I know
she thinks me too old to wear pink; but, as I said to her,
“Beauty is its own excuse for being,” and the rosy streaks
of sunset are as beautifully tender as the auroral glow of
morn. And why may I not be clad like the sunset?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> Why, of course you may. (<i>Aside</i>) There is
no one to say you may not; but can you, and not look like
a guy, that is the question. (<i>Aloud</i>) Speaking of Pet, is
Mintra not here? Ah, there she is.</p>

<p class="hanging">(<span class="smcap">Mintra</span> <i>enters and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy</span> <i>meets her, goes front;
other ladies go through different gestures very awkwardly,
laughing and talking with one another</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Mintra, dear, I want so much to see you
for a moment. I must enlighten you in a matter upon
which I happen to be informed, and you do not. Old Mr.
Fossil is here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> (<i>starting</i>) Is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Yes, and Tom Bestman told my <span class="lock">husband—you</span>
know what old friends they are, and you will forgive
it, I <span class="lock">know—he</span> told my husband that his uncle was furious
with him. Your aunt does not know of your engagement,
does she?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> No, indeed; I have told her nothing about it.
She has only seen Tom twice, and doesn’t know he has an
uncle. You know mamma could not have told her, for she
did not stop in Philadelphia at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Well, Tom’s uncle vows he shall never
marry any one but a strong-minded daughter of the soil;
at <span class="lock">least—not</span> exactly <span class="lock">that—but</span> he advocates only sensible
women, as he calls them, and objects in the most strenuous
manner to high heels, small waists, and society foibles and
follies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Not at all well. You dear, silly little
goose (<i>putting her arm affectionately around her</i>), do you
know what that means? Why, it means that your dear
Tom is thrown off to shift for himself, and instead of having
a very comfortable berth he will have nothing at all; and
though he is by no means a fool, yet it will be years before
he is in a position to marry, if he doesn’t marry to please his
uncle, and his uncle has conceived a frantic dislike to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Yes, “me” (<i>mimicking her</i>), and “me”
must go to work and disabuse the old gentleman of his
ridiculous ideas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> But how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> My dear goosie, you see the means before
you. Physical culture, of course. Send to the city for
low-heeled shoes; increase your waist measure at least four
inches; be an enthusiastic walker; stand up straight; give
him the idea that your one aim in life is to be sensible,
that your ideal of perfection is a healthy peasant, <span class="lock">and—well,</span>
that is all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> (<i>enthusiastically</i>) I’ll do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> (<i>approaching</i>) Ah, Pet, dear! you see I
was right to wear my pink gown. I have received many
compliments, I assure you. “I builded better than I
knew,” as dear Emerson says. I want to tell you something,
I met such a charming man just before I came upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> (<i>indifferently</i>) Who was it, auntie? You meet
so many “charming men.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> (<i>coquettishly</i>) Now, Pet, how can I help it
if they make themselves charming to me? Surely I do
nothing to attract them, and you know how terribly soon
my ideals vanish. But this time!—O Pet! (<i>theatrically</i>),
“When half gods go, the gods arrive!” and Mr. Fossil is
Jove-like in his dignity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> (<i>excitedly</i>) Mr. Fossil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> Yes, Mr. Fossil; and O Pet! he is so interested
in our club, and he asked <span class="lock">me—well</span> (<i>coyly</i>), perhaps
he should not have done so upon so short an
acquaintance; but when I told him that we proposed
giving an exhibition of our talent to the guests of the
house, at a later date, he asked me (<i>giggles</i>), he asked me
if he might come, and I said yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> (<i>laughing</i>) Well, auntie, I don’t think that was
so terribly forward. I shall not object, for one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bodkin.</span> O Mrs. Frisk! do you know your lesson?
(<i>Proceeds with a stanza of</i> “Young Lochinvar,” <i>hesitates
and breaks down</i>.) There! I knew I could not do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> Oh! never mind. You will be all right. At
any rate, there are plenty to keep you company. I wonder
where Miss Stein is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pallide.</span> She will be a little late, I think, for I saw
her talking to Mr. Fossil, and you know his hobby. Do
you know I cannot remember that neck movement to save
my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Several.</span> Oh! can’t you? Why, this is it. (<i>All proceed
to show her, differently.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Pallide.</span> I don’t see that I am any wiser than I

Do, somebody see if I say this correctly. (<i>Begins another
stanza of</i> “Lochinvar,” <i>but stops to giggle</i>) Now, Mrs. Frisk,
if you look at me in that way I cannot say it. I’ll tell Miss
Stein of you. There she is now. (<i>All rush up to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss

<p class="hanging">SCENE—<i>Porch of hotel. Gravel walk across stage in front
of porch. Exits</i> <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr> <i>and</i> <abbr title="Left"><span class="allsmcap">L.</span></abbr> <i>Main entrance to hotel</i> <abbr title="Center"><span class="allsmcap">C.</span></abbr> <i>in
flat. Full-length windows</i>, <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr> <i>and</i> <abbr title="Left"><span class="allsmcap">L.</span></abbr> <i>Wicker chairs scattered

seated down</i> <abbr title="Left"><span class="allsmcap">L.</span></abbr></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> (<i>rising</i>) Yes, sir, I say that the young men
of the present day are idiots. Yes, sir, brainless idiots. Do
you suppose for one instant, sir, that I intend my money to
go toward supporting a race of wasp-waisted, deformed,
hollow-chested women? (<i>Walking about porch excitedly</i>)
Not for my right hand. I would rather see you married to
a German peasant with thick ankles and a thick head than
to a simpering silly society girl tottering along on her high-heeled,
pointed-toed shoes. (<i>Stopping before</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>) Look at
that. (<i>Takes a slipper from his pocket</i>) That is the kind of
shoe I mean. Now, can you deny that this is the same
style of footgear that your charming, lovely Mintra wears?
(<i>Takes out a photograph</i>) I found this stuck in your mirror.
Look at that waist. No wonder she stands with her back
to you. I should think she would be ashamed to show her
face. How does she breathe? Where are her lungs?
Where is her heart? No, sir, it is time this <span class="lock">folly—no,</span> it is
worse than <span class="lock">folly—this</span> crime, I call <span class="lock">it—should</span> be stopped,
and I, for one, give no consent toward the encouragement
of monstrosities. Now, you have my answer. You can
marry your high-heeled, wasp-waisted, narrow-chested deformed
ninny if you want to; but if you do, you leave my
office at once, and every cent of my money shall go toward
the founding of gymnasiums for women.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> But, uncle, you do not expect me to give up the
girl I love simply because she does not measure a yard
around her waist. What in the world has that to do with
her moral character or her lovely, amiable qualities?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> It has everything to do with them. A girl
that distorts the body the Lord gave her hasn’t proper
moral perception, and as for her charming qualities, I suppose
you can live on them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> But, uncle, it is ridiculous to take a dislike to a
girl you have never seen. Let me present you, <span class="lock">and—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> No, and I do not wish to see her. I hope
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
I never shall. I know enough of the species already. I
shall go back to the city to-night, and I expect you to go
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Now, sir, that is a little too much. She is just like
all girls. I mean she isn’t like all girls, but she has had no
opportunity for doing differently because she has had no
example before her, and you surely do not expect me <span class="lock">to—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> I expect nothing, and if her nonsensical
style suits you my ideas do not, so there is an end of it.
(<i>Exit</i> <abbr title="Center"><span class="allsmcap">C.</span></abbr>)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mintra</span>, <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr>) Tom, is that you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> (<i>rising</i>) Yes; what is left of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Why, what is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Oh, nothing but what I shall have to stand. Uncle
expects me to go back to the city with him to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Well, never mind. You can come back again.
Now, Tom, don’t look so glum. You know I want you to
stay, but old people are apt to be a bit cranky, and it is best
to humor them sometimes, then they get over their little
tempers sooner. You should see how I have to manage
Auntie. Was he so very angry when <span class="lock">you—when</span> you told
him about me? (<i>shyly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> (<i>savagely</i>) Yes. Confound his impudence!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Now, Tom, don’t be so savage. You know
“the course of true love,” and if it is only this I don’t mind.
As long as you are my own dear boy, the whole world may
turn against me. We’ll have him on our side yet, you see
if we do not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You dear little girl (<i>puts his arm around her</i>), if
he could but see you once, he couldn’t help being on your
side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Tom, have I such a very small waist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes, you are quite like a wasp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Oh, you mean thing. I am not like one of
those horrid, shiny, blue wasps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> No, I didn’t mean a wasp. I meant a dear little
busy bee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> The reason I asked <span class="lock">is—but,</span> please promise
not to tell any one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> All right, I promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> You know there is a club organized here, just
to fill up this stupid season, and you know how dull it is for
me when you are not here, for I cannot write to you every
hour in the day. Well, at first I wasn’t a bit interested, but
I really am now. You see I had never thought of narrow
chests, or little bits of waists being so very injurious. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
thought it was just a fad of old people, like Auntie; but
when I heard Miss Stein <span class="lock">talk—you</span> know she has come
down to give us <span class="lock">lessons—I</span> was converted at once, it all
seemed so sensible. And so I have joined the club for
Physical Culture, <span class="lock">and—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> (<i>rapturously</i>) You have!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Yes. Are you glad? Do you approve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Approve! I should think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> I am so glad. Well, now you see, I practice
often, oh! real often, and Tom, although you don’t seem to
think so, I am ever and ever so many inches larger in the
waist. And now the funny thing I was going to tell you is
this: I sent to the city for some low-heeled shoes, for I
have discarded all my high heels; but last night as I was
going to close my shutters, one of them stuck. I couldn’t
quite reach the catch, so I took up one of my high-heeled
<span class="lock">slippers—for</span> the heel makes an excellent <span class="lock">hammer—and</span> as
the catch sprang suddenly, it knocked the slipper out of my
hand and it went flying out of the window. Of course, it
was dark, but I told one of the hall boys to try and find it,
and this morning he said he had hunted everywhere, but it
was not to be seen. Now, who in the world do you suppose
could have picked it up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ha! ha! ha! That is funny! Forgive me, my
darling, but it is so funny, I can’t help laughing. I think
I could tell where it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> O Tom! did you find it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Never mind who found it. I have seen it, and that
is all I shall tell you. It is perfectly safe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Well! I think you are very mean. Do,
please, throw it away where no one can find it. Do, like a
good boy. Now I must go. You must not worry, dear.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
gracious, now did she hear of that little speculation? I
might as well own up. (<i>Aloud</i>) I know, my dear, I should
have had more poise; but you know I don’t often lose my
head, and a man certainly does need a royal margin when
he is dabbling in stocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Joseph Alljoy, are you crazy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> No. Are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Not at all. My mind is perfectly clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> I, Joseph Alljoy, being of sound <span class="lock">mind—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Joseph, you certainly are insane. I presume
you have left at the club the small amount of brains
you once possessed. Now at my <span class="lock">club—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> Ye powers above! She has a club! Clubs
are trumps, and we seem to hold a full hand. How fortunate
that you are my partner! I thought you always
called for diamonds though?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Well, I don’t get them if I <span class="lock">do—not</span> when
you deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> Now, Lolly, don’t let’s quarrel. We have
done so much of it lately, and you have seemed so like
your old self, for the past few days, that I <span class="lock">hoped—indeed,</span>
I did hope that our old happy days might come back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> But you didn’t go to the club, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> Neither did you. No, hearts were trumps,

You cannot go anywhere with me now; but you are well
enough to go to clubs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> O Mr. Fossil! it is cruel of you to leave

we must try and be contented, for Emerson says “Discontent
is the want of self-reliance; it is the infirmity of will.”
Now you must promise me again before you go that you
will surely return to witness our little attempt to illustrate
Physical Culture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Well, really, Miss Doting, <span class="lock">I—ahem!—I</span> do
not know whether my business will permit <span class="lock">me—but—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> (<i>with a little scream of dismay</i>) O Mr.

me. Your presence wanting will cast the gloom of
discouragement over us all, for we had hoped our champion
would surely support us. You know (<i>coyly</i>) we are only
debutantes, and need a great deal of coaxing and petting.
(<i>with another little scream</i>) Oh, no! I don’t mean petting.
I <span class="lock">mean—encouragement.</span> As dear Pet, my niece, says:
“Auntie, you will never be anything but a child,” and

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Very true, very true, Miss Doting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> Now, Mr. Fossil, we can depend upon
you, I know. I should so like you to see Pet, my dear niece.
We are like sisters, and in this little club of ours she is so
in sympathy with me. Fancy the dear child discarding all
her pretty slippers, and wearing low heels; fancy her clothing
her dear young form in the garb of a true dress reformer.
You should see her pretty, graceful movements,
free as the bird that wings its way over yon ocean; free as
the curling wave that laps the bleaching sand. Oh, those
exquisite movements of grace! O Beauty! Beauty! how
I adore thee! Yes, Mr. Fossil, you should see my dear,
heroic little niece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> I should like to see her, madam. A girl
nowadays who is willing to elevate this degenerate race
by discarding its follies and vanities, is a girl after my own
heart. Miss Pet must be a niece to be proud of, and it
speaks well for the teachings of her aunt, that she is so
tractable and amiable as to follow her suggestions. I wish
my nephew were as obedient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> You have a nephew, Mr. Fossil?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Yes, madam, my dead sister’s son, to whom
I have been a father, and who now despises my counsels
and derides my opinions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> O Mr. Fossil! how can he? One so
good, so noble, so truly wise in his judgments should be
listened to as we listen to truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Thank you, thank you, Miss Doting. I
think I must try and manage to get down to your little exhibition,
and I anticipate much pleasure in meeting your
niece. And now, my dear madam, I must make my adieux,
for I fear it is train time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Indeed, yes, Miss Pet, I cannot express to
you the great pleasure it gives me to meet a young lady so
admirably sensible. Your aunt tells me you are an enthusiast
in the matter of Physical Culture. “Strength before
beauty” is my motto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> O Mr. Fossil! but beauty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Pardon me. I should say, “Strength is
beauty.” The beauty of the vine depending upon the
strength of its support, though it be nothing but the solid
ground; the beauty of the rose taking its strength from the
parent stalk. Fill nature with weakness and disease, and
there you have ugliness, repulsive distortion. Ah, my dear
young lady, I wish all women could realize that it is
strength of body which makes beauty. You are fond of
walking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Oh, yes! I can walk miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> And return rosy and unwearied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> But you know, auntie, how the English women
walk; and look at our own country girls. Why, even our

lady, I should soon get tired.

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Most sensibly spoken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Thank you, Mr. Fossil. I knew you must be
an advocate of fresh air. Isn’t it delightful to take in great
draughts of pure oxygen and expand your lungs till you
feel so invigorated that you long to dwell on a mountain
top for the rest of your life? (<i>Aside</i>) I’ve been rehearsing

tell you I should not be long in giving my consent.</p>

what <span class="lock">he—I</span> mean what you thought of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> (<i>innocently</i>) Why, Tom, he is a dear, lovely old

lately, and if I am stupid or dense you must overlook it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> (<i>turning to him, and putting out both hands</i>) O
Tom, you are dense! I thought you would be so happy;
I am. Don’t make me say so. Cannot you see how easy

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> (<i>laughingly</i>) Ah, Mr. Fossil, remember what
you said awhile ago. You do not know to what tales I may
be listening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> I certainly indorse anything I may have
said to you, Miss Pet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> Do you? Very well (<i>aside to</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>), present me
as your <i>fiancée</i>. Do hurry, Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> (<i>looking rather dazed</i>) Uncle, let me present you to
my promised wife, Miss Mintra Triptoe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> (<i>looking very much surprised</i>) Your promised
wife? Miss Mintra Triptoe? Why, I imagined this young
lady to be Miss <span class="lock">Doting—Miss</span> Pet Doting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mintra.</span> No, Mr. Fossil, auntie is Miss Doting. I am her
sister’s child, and all the family call me Pet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Well, I am amazed. Nevertheless, my dear,
I am delighted as well. You little cajoler. Ha! ha! ha!
Pretty well done. Ha! ha! ha!</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Ah, Miss Doting, it seems that there is a
possibility of our being more nearly related, and that your
niece may be my niece, and my nephew your nephew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> O Mr. Fossil! this is so unexpected.
How have I won such a prize?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Prize? I am not sure about there being
any great prize won, excepting on my side. If all is, as I
hope it is, the prize will be won by my side of the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> O Mr. Fossil! what an adept you are
in the language of love!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> I? Not a bit of it. Well, perhaps I may
have been rather effusive to the lady; but I hope she did
not think too much so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> Too much so! How can you imagine it?
What so delightful to a woman’s ears as the graceful appreciation
of the man she <span class="lock">admires—respects—adores—</span>(<i>puts
out both hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> (<i>taking her hands</i>) Well, Miss Doting, I had
no idea that your niece was so impressed by my unworthy
self, but she shall find me a warm friend. Yes, madam, we
are to be congratulated. I will do my best for the young
couple, and Tom will understand that his old uncle hasn’t
such poor judgment after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> (<i>withdrawing her hands</i>) Your nephew!
My niece! <span class="lock">I—I—do</span> not understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Neither did I, at first; but the sly things
told me they were engaged. My nephew, Tom Bestman,
to your niece, Miss <span class="lock">Pet—no,</span> I mean Miss Mintra <span class="lock">Do—no,</span> I
mean Triptoe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> O, cruel! cruel! not to have told me at
once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fossil.</span> Not at all! not at all! Now, Miss Doting,
pray do not take it in that way. Young folks like a little
secret. I don’t blame them. Come, come, we old folks
must give them our blessing and be happy with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Doting.</span> (<i>aside</i>) Old folks! O, crueller still! Ah
well, “What does not come to us is not ours.” (<i>Aloud</i>) I
suppose I must not be too harsh, Mr. Fossil; let us find
them; but we should remember that Emerson says “the
passion of which we speak, though it begins with the
young, does not forsake the old,” and you are scarcely old
yet, Mr. Fossil. (<i>Takes his arm and they walk off</i>, <abbr title="Right"><span class="allsmcap">R.</span></abbr>)</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Now, Joe, you see my club is perfectly
harmless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> I congratulate you, Laura, I do, indeed.
You are a trump. By George! but it was a revelation to
me. I hadn’t an idea you women could be so limber. You
looked stunning, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> And you’ll find it doesn’t stop here. I’ll
take a five-mile walk with you to-morrow, if you say so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> Good! we’ll do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> And, Joe, you may rustle the paper all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
you choose, and if you go to the club, remember, I’m going
too. Somehow I’ve given up being an invalid, so you’d
better not let me be alone too much, with all this newly acquired
energy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> I shall not want to go to the club if you
will only be good company for me. To tell you the truth,
the club is getting to be an awful bore, and I am about sick
of clubs. That is a fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Alljoy.</span> Then we’ll begin all over again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frisk.</span> (<i>coming down</i>) Isn’t she a lively invalid, Mr.
Alljoy? You may thank me for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alljoy.</span> I do, most heartily. She’s her old self, indeed.
Ah, here comes Tom and Mintra.</p>

Fossil.</p>
